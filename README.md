# # Module 1 Challenge

This project was about cleaning up the code to include semantic HTML elements to make the site more accessible to those who might need it.

I was able to accomplish this by:

-Adding alt elements to images
-Placing the header elements in order
-Consolidating some of the elements in CSS
-Changing the font size

I learned what cleaned up code looks like and it is always best to leave the code cleaner than how you found it because someone else will probably need to look at it down the line. 

The original starter code came from the repository that can be found here:
